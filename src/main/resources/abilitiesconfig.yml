# ===============================
# Ability Defaults (Global)
# ===============================
# This file defines the DEFAULT settings for each ability.
#
# IMPORTANT:
# - This file does NOT enable abilities by itself.
#   Abilities are enabled per-mob (mobsconfig.yml) or via random-mobs (config.yml).
#
# How settings are chosen (highest priority first):
#  1) Mob-specific settings (mobsconfig.yml) for that mob + ability
#  2) Default settings from this file (abilitiesconfig.yml)
#  3) Plugin built-in defaults (hardcoded in the plugin) if a setting is missing in both files
#
# Using defaults on a mob:
# - In mobsconfig.yml, you can set an ability to {} (empty settings).
#   That means: "use the defaults" from this file (and built-in defaults if needed).
